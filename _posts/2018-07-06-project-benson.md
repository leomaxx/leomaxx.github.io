title: Project Benson - NYC Subway Traffic Analysis
---

This is the first project in my Metis data science bootcamp in San Feancisco Summer 2018. Through this project, I learnt what's required to not only survive, but to make the most of the bootcamp: 

1. Start early, as things move really fast
2. Ready to learn new techniques along the way
3. Collaborate with team members and learn from each other
